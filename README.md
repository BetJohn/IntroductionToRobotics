# Homework 0:

Task1: Install Arduino IDE. :heavy_check_mark: You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

# Homework 1: (Comming soon...)

Task: Create a breadboard circuit with a LED which is adjusted by 3 potentiometers. :heavy_check_mark:

### In this task I used: 
### 3 Potentioemeters
### 3 Resistors
### 1 RGB LED
### 1 Breadboard
### 1 Arduino UNO
### 1 USB cable
### Many Cables

I have connected the 3 potentiometers to analog pins A0,A1 and A2. 

The RGB LED is connected to digital pins 9,10 and 11. 

The resistors are connected to every RGB pin.

The RGB LED pins get the values from the potentiometers mapped from 0 to 255.

## This is the circuit setup
