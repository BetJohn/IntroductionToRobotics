# IntroductionToRobotics

### Welcome everybody! :wave: :sunflower: :sunflower:

In this repository you can find all the projects and knowledge on a basic level of Robotics.

Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

Starting from this point, you can see all the homework:

## Homework 0:

Task1: Install Arduino IDE. :heavy_check_mark: You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 

![This is the latest version of Arduino IDE](https://github.com/BetJohn/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Arduino%20IDE%20-%20Photo.jpg)


## Homework 1: RGB LED :bulb:

Task: Create a breadboard circuit with a LED which is adjusted by 3 potentiometers. :heavy_check_mark:

### In this task I used: 
### 3 Potentioemeters, 3 Resistors, 1 RGB LED, 1 Breadboard, 1 Arduino UNO,1 USB cable and many cables

I have connected the 3 potentiometers to analog pins A0,A1 and A2. 

The RGB LED is connected to digital pins 9,10 and 11. 

The resistors are connected to every RGB pin.

The RGB LED pins get the values from the potentiometers mapped from 0 to 255.

## Homework 2: Elevator simulator :elevator: 

Task: Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform

### Materials used:
### 3 Butttons, 4 LEDs, 1 Breadboard, 1 Arduino UNO, 1 USB cable, 1 Buzzer and many cables

I have connected the 3 buttons to digital pins 2,3 and 4.

The 4 LEDs are connected to digital pins 11,12,13 and 7(blinking LED).

The buzzer is connected to digital pin 5.

The LEDs are used to show the current floor and the blinking LED is used to show the elevator is moving.

The buzzer is used to make a sound when the elevator arrives at a floor.
